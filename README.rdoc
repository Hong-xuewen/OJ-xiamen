== Bitcoin Central
Bitcoin Central powers bitcoin-central.net, a bitcoin trading platform. It is :

* Open Source,
* Based on Ruby on Rails,
* Fully localizable,
* Multi-currency.

== Installation
Linux and Windows setup work well, I found the easiest to be an Ubuntu install

=== Windows
* Install Ruby and MySQL
* Install Ruby Development Kit (https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit)
* Install rubygems

=== Linux (Debian flavors)
* Install required packages
 $ sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev libssl-dev irb rubygems mysql

* Add gem binaries to path and re-login
 # First line of /etc/environment should show something like this
 PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin"

* Update rubygems if necessary (http://programmers-blog.com/2009/04/12/ruby-gem-update-system-is-disabled-on-debian)

=== Common
* Install rails and bundler
 $ sudo gem install rails bundler

* Fork project if relevant
* Check out sources with git
* Install the required gems
 $ cd [SOURCE PATH]
 $ bundle

* Log-in to MySQL console and run the following
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON bitcoin-bank_development.* TO 'rails'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'rails';

* Run a couple of rake tasks
 $ rake db:create
 $ rake db:migrate

* Edit config/bitcoin.yml to be able to connect your instance to a bitcoin client

* Run the rails server
 $ rails s

Your fresh instance should now be running on http://localhost:3000/ !
